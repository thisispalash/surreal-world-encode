## Purpose and Scope

The platform aims to empower individuals to run structured personal experiments with a sample size of one, improving their health and lifestyle choices. It also enables researchers to create and deploy large-scale studies, leveraging community participation and existing data. The platform aims to democratize scientific experimentation and foster a collaborative ecosystem.

## User Stories

### Personal Experimentation

1. As a user, I want to create small personal experiments to track how lifestyle changes affect my health.

2. As a user, I want a simple interface to log my daily feelings or data points and compare results over time.

### Researchers Creating Experiments

3. As a researcher, I want to design and deploy structured studies using custom widgets to gather specific data from participants.

4. As a researcher, I want access to a dashboard to monitor real-time data and analyze results.

### Researchers Using Existing Data

5. As a researcher, I want to access anonymized, aggregate data from user experiments to derive insights and validate hypotheses.

### Participants in Researcher Studies

6. As a participant, I want to easily join and contribute to studies that align with my interests or health goals.

### Business Use Case

7. As a provider of sensors, I want to expand my reach to sell more sensor based devices.

8. As a provider of sensors, I want to increase the utility value for my customers.

## List of Requirements

### Functional

- Widget Creation Tools: A flexible interface for researchers to create custom widgets (lenses) combining various quanta and photons.

- Data Capture and Logging: Allow users to log daily metrics or feelings manually or through integrations with devices like Garmin.

- Dashboards and Analytics: A comprehensive dashboard for researchers to monitor and analyze experiment data in real-time.

- Marketplace: A marketplace for quanta and photons, allowing both free and paid elements, with potential partnerships for specialized data sources.

### Non-Functional

- Scalability: Support for a growing number of users and experiments.

- Security: Ensure data privacy and secure storage of user information.

- Usability: Maintain an intuitive interface for both users and researchers.

## Success Metrics

- Number of personal experiments created and completed.

- Number of researcher-led studies and participant engagement.

- User satisfaction and feedback on the platformâ€™s ease of use.
